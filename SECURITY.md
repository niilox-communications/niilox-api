# Security model

This document is for anyone running Drift in production or considering reselling access to the API. It covers what the codebase enforces today, what it explicitly does not, and the safe defaults to add if you go to market.

## What the code enforces

### Authentication & authorisation

- All `/api/v1/*` routes that touch tenant data require either a registered Drift JWT or a guest JWT (both HS256 signed with `JWT_SECRET`).
- `middleware.RequireRegistered` rejects guest tokens with 403 on every write route (room creation, chat, gifts, payments, DMs, withdrawals, stage actions, moderation, ID verification).
- Native auth providers issue Drift access + refresh tokens; refresh sessions are stored hashed in `auth_sessions`.
- Per-tenant livestream tokens (broadcast SFU, `drift` tenant) are minted with the tenant's own SFU secret. One tenant cannot mint tokens for another.
- Admin endpoints check server-side admin membership per tenant. There is no `is_admin` claim in the JWT.

### Tenant isolation

- Every tenant-scoped query carries `app_id`. There is no implicit cross-tenant access path.
- Livestream webhooks recover `app_id` from the room name (`{app}::{host}::{ts}`) and verify the webhook signature against that tenant's SFU secret.
- `apps.Registry` caches per-tenant livestream and media-storage clients keyed by `apps.id`.
- `users` remains tenant-scoped. Identities are isolated by `app_id` and mapped to tenant-local user rows.

### Input handling

- Display names are trimmed and capped at 24 chars.
- Chat messages are capped at 300 chars.
- DM text is capped at 500 chars; media URLs must originate from the tenant's Niilox media CDN (URLs we issued).
- Avatar / DM media / ID-verification uploads are size-limited (5 MB / 8 MB / 8 MB each).
- Social link handles are sanitised: trimmed, length-capped (200), and `javascript:` / `data:` / `vbscript:` URLs are rejected.
- ID verification files are named with kind + timestamp (`verify/{user}/doc-20260521131500.jpg`) so `doc` and `selfie` don't collide.
- Withdrawal amounts must be ≥100 tokens and cannot exceed the user's `earned_from_gifts - paid - pending` balance (i.e. you cannot withdraw money you topped up).

### Payment safety

- `payments.handler.handleWebhook` updates `token_purchases` with `WHERE status='pending'` so a replayed webhook never double-credits.
- Card checkout webhooks are verified against an ops-provisioned signing secret per tenant.
- Bank checkout webhooks are verified against an ops-provisioned hash secret per tenant.
- Token balance updates run inside a transaction when withdrawing.

### Chargeback / friendly fraud (migration `015`)

The API listens for card lifecycle events and resolves them through the same handler:

| Event | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | Credit tokens. Stores payment reference on `token_purchases` so future dispute / refund webhooks can find the row. |
| `charge.dispute.created` | Soft clawback. Tokens revoked, `users.dispute_count++`. After two events the account is auto-suspended (`suspended_at` set, `suspension_reason='chargeback_threshold'`). |
| `charge.dispute.closed` (`status=lost`) | Permanent clawback. Marks purchase `disputed`. |
| `charge.dispute.closed` (`status=won` / `warning_closed`) | Decrements `dispute_count` and lifts the suspension if it was caused by chargebacks. Tokens are **not** restored — the user already lost them on `dispute_open`. |
| `charge.refunded` | Same as `dispute_lost`: clawback + flag, purchase marked `refunded`. |

Idempotency: every dispute write hits `payment_disputes` first, which has `UNIQUE (provider, external_id, kind)`. A replayed webhook event is a no-op.

`RequireActive(db)` middleware blocks suspended users on `/tokens/checkout` and `/rooms/{id}/gifts` (the two laundering surfaces). The middleware caches the lookup for 5 s; `InvalidateSuspensionCache(userID)` forces an immediate re-read after an admin unsuspends.

| `payment_intent.payment_failed` | Marks the `token_purchases` row `failed` (card declined). No credit. |

**Webhook destination configuration.** Niilox ops configures inbound webhooks for your tenant to receive all six events above. Until configured, dispute clawbacks will silently no-op (the events never reach the server).

### Realtime hub

- Each WS connection authenticates via the `?token=` query param parsed against `JWT_SECRET`.
- Slow clients are dropped from broadcasts (channel buffers of 64 / 128). They don't back-pressure the hub.
- `DisconnectUser` closes every connection a kicked user has in a room.

## What the code does NOT enforce

These are intentional gaps you should close before selling the API publicly.

| Concern | Today | Recommended hardening |
|---------|-------|------------------------|
| Per-IP / per-app rate limiting | **yes** — Redis sliding window on `/api/v1` (in-memory fallback without `REDIS_URL`) | Tune `RATE_LIMIT_*_PER_MIN`; add WAF for edge DDoS. Per-user limits apply when JWT is present on the same request. |
| Tenant API keys + HMAC | **yes** — `niilox_sk_…` keys in `app_api_keys`; optional `X-Drift-Timestamp` + `X-Drift-Signature` | Manage keys at `/admin/api` (UI) or `GET/POST /api/v1/platform/keys`. Video/join routes still require user JWT — keys are for integrator read/ping flows. |
| Orphan room reconcile | **yes** — background worker compares broadcast SFU room list vs DB | Tune `RECONCILE_INTERVAL`; does not delete SFU rooms. |
| PgBouncer / pool tuning | **partial** — `DB_POOL_MAX_CONNS` / `DB_POOL_MIN_CONNS` on pgxpool | Deploy PgBouncer in transaction mode in front of Postgres (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`). |
| WebSocket origin checks | `CheckOrigin` returns `true` | Replace with an allowlist (`APP_URL` + any partner origins). |
| Brute-force protection on auth routes | partial | Add per-IP limits / captcha on `/auth/password/*`, `/auth/magic/send`, and `/auth/phone/send`. |
| Login throttling / lockout | partial | Add progressive lockout policy for repeated password failures. |
| Server-side webhook IP filtering | none | Accept only ops-configured webhooks from documented IP ranges or via signed payload (the latter is already enforced). |
| Audit log | none | Add an `audit_log` table for admin actions (verifications, withdrawals, kicks). |
| Soft-delete of users | none — `ON DELETE CASCADE` removes follows, DMs, etc. | Add a `deleted_at` column and switch foreign keys to `ON DELETE SET NULL` if you need data retention. |
| Encryption at rest of DM media | files are public CDN URLs | Use token-based signed CDN URLs for reads. |
| Anti-CSRF | the API is JWT-bearer only, not cookie-based, so CSRF is not directly applicable | Keep using `Authorization: Bearer`. Never store the Drift JWT in cookies. |

## Secrets

- `JWT_SECRET` — 32+ random bytes. Rotating invalidates all sessions; users re-sign in.
- Livestream SFU credentials — per tenant in `apps` (provisioned by Niilox ops). Don't read from env in handlers — always go through `apps.Registry`.
- Payment signing secrets — process-scoped, ops-provisioned. Rotate via your secrets manager.
- Media storage credentials — writable per-tenant zone. Limit blast radius with zone-scoped passwords.
- `.env` is git-ignored. The repo refuses to commit any `.env*` except `.env.example`.

## Threat model snapshot

| Adversary | What they can try | What stops them |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Random internet user | Hit `/api/v1/*` without auth | `middleware.Auth` returns 401. |
| Guest token holder | Send chat, buy tokens, create rooms | `RequireRegistered` returns 403. |
| Cross-tenant attacker | Send `X-App-ID: rabbaly` while signed into Drift | The Drift JWT's `sub` is `users.id` for `app_id='drift'`. The Rabbaly handlers SELECT with `WHERE app_id='rabbaly' AND id=$sub` and get nothing. |
| Replayed webhook | Resubmit a payment webhook | `UPDATE … WHERE status='pending'` is idempotent. |
| Stolen Drift JWT | Impersonate the user for up to 7 days | Shorten access-token TTL and enforce refresh rotation/revocation. |
| Underage publisher in `adult` room | Bypass age check | `apps.allow_adult` must be true AND `users.id_verified` must be true. There is no way to bypass without an admin approving an ID submission. |
| Malicious upload (RCE via file content) | Upload a polyglot to `/users/me/avatar` | Content-type and extension are restricted; files are served by the tenant CDN as static, never executed by this binary. Add server-side virus scanning if your tenant niche demands it. |
